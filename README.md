# Magic8-Ball
This watchOS application that I built is a Magic 8-Ball complication. The idea of this project is derived from the actual Magic 8-Ball Game. It is an oversized date ball that’s filled with water and has a clear plastic window at the bottom. On shaking it up, it shows a prediction.

Now, a complication on an Apple Watch is anything that is not the Time. For example – a weather app or a maps app or anything surrounding the time on the watch. All these are called complications. I worked on this and also implemented Time Travel. Time Travel is the ability to use the digital crown to wind time forwards or backwards and see how the complications will look later on. 

Suppose, a user of this application has weather complication installed on his Apple Watch. Now, using this app, he/she can wind time forward to three hours and see what the weather is like later on.

In this project, I learnt about working with clock kit, complications controller, handler() methods, timeline methods and sets.
